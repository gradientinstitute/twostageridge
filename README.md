This repository contains a simplified implementation of the two stage
regression model in:

Hahn, P.R., Carvalho, C.M., Puelz, D., He, J., 2018. Regularization and
Confounding in Linear Regression for Treatment Effect Estimation. Bayesian
Anal. 13. https://doi.org/10.1214/16-BA1044

This is a maximum a-posteriori treatment rather than a fully Bayesian treatment
of the regression weights. The bias of the ATE/CATE was computed using this
model in the original paper.
