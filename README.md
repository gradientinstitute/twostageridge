TwoStageRidge
=============

A simple implementation of the two-stage ridge regression model described in
Hahn et. al (2018) with a scikit-learn compatible API. This model allows us to
use many and potentially highly correlated control variables with observational
causal inference.

We have implemented maximum a-posteriori models rather than the fully Bayesian
treatment of the regression weights as described in (Hahn et. al, 2018). The
model implemented is;

1. Selection model: Z = **X**Î²<sub>c</sub> + Îµ,
2. Response model: Y = Î±(Z - **X**Î²<sub>c</sub>) + **X**Î²<sub>d</sub> + Î½.

Here **X**, Y and Z are random variables. **X** are the controls, Z is the
treatment, and Y is the outcome. Î²<sub>c</sub> are first stage the linear
regression weights, Î²<sub>d</sub> are the second stage linear regression
weights on the control variables. Î± is the average treatment effect (ATE), and
Îµ ~ N(0, Ïƒ<sup>2</sup><sub>Îµ</sub>), Î½ ~ N(0, Ïƒ<sup>2</sup><sub>Î½</sub>).

We place *l*<sub>2</sub> regularizers on the regression weights in the
regression objective functions,

1. Selection model: Î»<sub>c</sub>Â·||Î²<sub>c</sub>||<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub>,
2. Response model: Î»<sub>d</sub>Â·||Î²<sub>d</sub>||<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub>.

No regularisation is applied to Î±. This formulation leads to a less biased
estimation of Î± over alternate ridge regression models. We can get an intuition
for this from the following graphical model,

Here round nodes with letters inside are random variables, square nodes are
deterministic functions, and âŠ• is addition/subtraction. Arrows denote the
direction of flow. This can be interpreted like a typical triangle graphical
model denoting the causal relationships X ðŸ – Y, X ðŸ – Z and Z ðŸ – Y but with the
addition of the stage 1 and 2 modelling influences.

We can see that the influence of the control variables, **X**, on the
treatment, Z, has explicitly been removed when predicting **Y** on the path Z ðŸ –
Y. That is, only the "residual" signal from the treatment variables, r, that is
not explained by the control variables is allowed to influence Y through Î±.
This results in the bias of alpha being a function of the regularisation
strength and the residual r, instead of the treatments Z, which results in a
low bias (but higher variance) estimator of Î±. 


Installation

This repository can be directly installed from GitHub, e.g.

    $ pip install git+git://github.com/gradientinstitute/twostageridge.git#egg=twostageridge


Quick start
-----------

`TwoStageRidge` uses a scikit learn interface. In order to retain compatibility
with all of the pipelines and model selection tools we have to treat the inputs
to the model specially. That is, we have to concatenate the control variables,
`X` and the treatment variables `Z` into one input array, e.g. `W =
np.hstack((Z, X))`. For example,

```python
import numpy as np
from twostagerigde import TwoStageRidge

X, Y, Z = load_data()  # for some data function

# Where:
# - X.shape -> (N, D)
# - Y.shape -> (N,)
# - Z.shape -> (N,)

W = np.hstack((Z[:, np.newaxis], X))

ts = TwoStageRidge(treatment_index=0)  # Column index of the treatment variable
ts.fit(W, Y)  # estimate causal effect, alpha

print(f"Î± = {ts.alpha_}, s.e.(Î±) = {ts.se_alpha_}, p-value = {ts.p_}")
```

This will print out the estimated average treatment effect, standard error, and
p-value of a two-sided t-test against a null hypothesis of Î± = 0. For more
information on how to use this model, and how to perform model selection for
the model parameters, see the [notebooks](notebooks).

Vector treatments, **Z**, can also be inferred. You just have to specify the
column indices of all treatment variables in `W`. For this you can use a numpy
array or a slice.
